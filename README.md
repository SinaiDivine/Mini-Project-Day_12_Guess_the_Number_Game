# 🎯 Day 12 – Guess-the-Number Game

## 📌 Project Description
This mini project is a simple **Guess-the-Number Game** built in Python.  
The program generates a random number between **1 and 50**, and the user must guess it.  
Hints are given after each guess:
- "Too low" if the guess is smaller
- "Too high" if the guess is larger  

The game continues until the user guesses correctly, and the program displays the total number of attempts.

## 🛠️ Features
- Random number generation using Python’s `random` module
- While loop for continuous guessing
- Input validation with error handling
- Tracks number of attempts

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python3 guess_number.py
